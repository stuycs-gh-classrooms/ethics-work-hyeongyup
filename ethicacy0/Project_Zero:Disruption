Disruption, the radical change to an existing industry or market due to technological innovation, has become very common in todayâ€™s economic world. With increasing access to computing power, technology adoption and information sharing, disruption has become easier and therefore more common. Although disruption is a very attractive business model, it still has some very large flaws.
For example, disruption leads to a lot of unpredictability. The appearance of innovative technology messes with the predictions of economists, business owners, and leaders all over the world.
	Another issue with disruption is its competitive nature. There have been many examples of how disruptive businesses have grown so large and removed all of their competition. Some of these businesses are Amazon, Uber, and Netflix. Each one of these businesses have changed how billions of people consume in their respective niches. Disruptive technology such as smartphones, AI, and GPS, have changed the world very quickly.
	But one of the biggest issues with disruption is its ability to grow unrefined products.
